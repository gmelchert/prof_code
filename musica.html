                Yeah, I'd rather be a lover than a fighter (fighter)
                'Cause all my life, I've been fighting
                Never felt a feeling of comfort, oh
                And all this time, I've been hiding
                And I never had someone to call my own, oh nah
                I'm so used to sharing
                Love only left me alone
                But I'm at one with the silence

                I found peace in your violence
                Can't show me, there's no point in trying
                I'm at one, and I've been quiet for too long
                I found peace in your violence
                Can't show me, there's no point in trying
                I'm at one, and I've been silent for too long
                
                I've been quiet for too long
                I've been quiet for too long
                I found peace in your violence
                Can't show me, there's no point in trying
                I'm at one, and I've been quiet for too long
                
                I'm in need of a savior (savior), but I'm not asking for favors
                My whole life, I've felt like a burden
                I think too much, and I hate it
                I'm so used to being in the wrong, I'm tired of caring
                Loving never gave me a home, so I'll sit here in the silence
                
                I found peace in your violence
                Can't show me, there's no point in trying
                I'm at one, and I've been quiet for too long
                I found peace in your violence
                Can't show me, there's no point in trying
                I'm at one, and I've been silent for too long
                
                I've been quiet for too long
                I've been quiet for too long
                I found peace in your violence
                Can't show me, there's no point in trying
                I'm at one, and I've been quiet for too long

                Oh, I beg you, can I follow?
                Oh, I ask you, why not always?
                Be the ocean, where I unravel
                Be my only
                Be the water where I'm wading
                
                You're my river running high
                Run deep, run wild
                
                I, I follow
                I follow you, deep sea, baby
                I follow you
                I, I follow
                I follow you, dark doom, honey
                I follow you
                
                He a message, I'm the runner
                He the rebel
                I'm the daughter waiting for you
                
                You're my river running high
                Run deep, run wild

            <textarea disabled rows="20" cols="80">
                I remember when I saw you at the end of that night
                I was lookin' for some trouble, you were lookin' alright
                Every time you said a word, I was starin' at your lips
                I don't think I've ever been so close to a love like this
                
                I never met someone, met someone like you
                I never felt this way, felt this way, ooh
                
                For ya love
                I would take potions
                For ya love
                I would cross oceans
                All the hurt
                And the pain
                You could take it all away
                For ya love, ooh
                I would take potions
                
                I would take potions
                I would take potions
                
                Sippin' on a little somethin', I been sippin' too much
                I just poured myself a double and I'm thinkin' 'bout us
                Every time I see your face, I think of what I lost
                How could all the little moments that we had be so far gone?
                
                I never met someone, met someone like you
                I never felt this way, felt this way, ooh
                
                For ya love
                I would take potions
                For ya love
                I would cross oceans
                All the hurt
                And the pain
                You could take it all away
                For ya love, ooh
                I would take potions
                
                I would take potions
